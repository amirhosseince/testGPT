# 3D Driving Game

This repository contains a small demo driving game built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

Open `driving-game/index.html` in a modern browser to try it. Use the arrow keys to drive.

The game now features a textured road, simple trees and buildings, a sky background and a realistic sports car model. Driving physics have been tweaked for smoother acceleration and turning.
